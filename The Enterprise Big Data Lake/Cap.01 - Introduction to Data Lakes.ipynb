The contents of a data lake stream in from a source to fill the lake, and various users of the data lake can come to examine, dive in, or take samples'.</i>"

    "* <i> Data Puddle: is basically a single purpose or single project data mart built using big data technology. Or is typically the first step in the adoption of big data technology. The data in a data puddle is loaded for the purpose of a single project or team. It is usually well known and well understood, and the reason that big data is used instead of traditional data warehousing is to lower cost and provide better performance.\n",
    "* Data pond: is a collection of data puddles. It may be like a poorly designed data warehouse, which is effectively a collection of colocated data marts, or it may be an offload of an existing data warehouse. While lower technology costs and better scalability are clear attractive benefits, these constructs still require a high level of IT participation. Furthermore, data ponds limit data to only that needed by the project, and use that data only for the project that requires it. Given the high IT costs and limited data availibility, data ponds do not really help us with the goalsof democratizing data usage or driving self-service and data-driven decision making for business users.\n",
    "* Data Lake: it is different from a data pond in two important ways. First, if supports self-service, where business users are able to find and use data sets that they want to use without having to rely on help from IT department. Second, it aims to contain data that business users might possibly want even if there is not project requiring it at the time.\n",
    "* Data Ocean: it expands self-service data and data-driven decision making to all enterprise data, wherever it may be, regardless it may be, regardless of whether it was loaded into data lake or not.\n",

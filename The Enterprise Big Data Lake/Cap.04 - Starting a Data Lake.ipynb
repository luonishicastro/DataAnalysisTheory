Ideally, make sure that you can demonstrate one valuable insight per quarter for the duration of the data lake construction; (2) Broaden the data lake beyond the original data science use cases as soon as possible by moving other workloads into the lake, from operational jobs like ETL to governance to simple BI and reporting; (3) Don't try to boil the ocean right away. Keep building up the cluster and adding data sources as you keep showing more value; (4) Focus on getting additional departments, teams, and projects to use the data lake.</i>"

    "<li>When the best course for visualizing certain data is unclear, start with a blank piece of paper.</li>\n",
    "<li>Sketch out potential views to see them side‐by‐side and determine what will work best for getting your message across to your audience.</li>\n",
    "<li>Create a version of the graph (let’s call it A), then make a copy of it (B) and make a single change. Then determine which looks better—A or B. Often, the practice of seeing slight variations next to each other makes it quickly clear which view is superior.</li>\n",
    "<li>At any point, if the best path is unclear, seek feedback. The fresh set of eyes that a friend or colleague can bring to the data visualization endeavor is invaluable.</li>\n",
    "<li>One of my biggest tips for success in storytelling with data is to allow adequate time for it. If we don’t consciously recognize that this takes time to do well and budget accordingly, our time can be entirely eaten up by the other parts of the analytical process.\n",
    "<li>Imitation really is the best form of flattery. If you see a data visualization or example of storytelling with data that you like, consider how you might adapt the approach for your own use. Pause to reflect on what makes it effective. Make a copy of it and create a visual library that you can add to over time and refer to for inspiration.</li>\n",
    "<li>There are a number of great blogs and resources on the topic of data visualization and communicating with data that contain many good examples. Here are a few of my current personal favorites:\n",

    "<li>To the extent that it makes sense given the task at hand, don’t be afraid to let your own style develop and creativity come through when you communicate with data. Company brand can also play a role in developing a data visualization style; consider your company’s brand and whether there are opportunities to fold that into how you visualize and communicate with data. Just make sure that your approach and stylistic elements are making the information easier—not more difficult—for your audience to consume.</li>\n",

    "<li>Understand the context. Build a clear understanding of who you are communicating to, what you need them to know or do,\n",

    "<li>Choose an appropriate visual display. When highlighting a number or two, simple text is best. Line charts are usually best\n",
    "for continuous data. Bar charts work great for categorical data and must have a zero baseline. Let the relationship you want to\n",
    "show guide the type of chart you choose. Avoid pies, donuts, 3D, and secondary y‐axes due to difficulty of visual interpretation.</li>\n",
    "<li>Eliminate clutter. Identify elements that don’t add informative value and remove them from your visuals. Leverage the Gestalt principles to understand how people see and identify candidates for elimination. Use contrast strategically. Employ alignment of elements and maintain white space to help make the interpretation of your visuals a comfortable experience for your audience.</li>\n",
    "<li>Focus attention where you want it. Employ the power of preattentive attributes like color, size, and position to signal what’s important. Use these strategic attributes to draw attention to where you want your audience to look and guide your audience through your visual. Evaluate the effectiveness of preattentive attributes in your visual by applying the “where are your eyes drawn?” test.</li>\n",
    "<li>Think like a designer. Offer your audience visual affordances as cues for how to interact with your communication: highlight the important stuff, eliminate distractions, and create a visual hierarchy of information. Make your designs accessible by not overcomplicating and leveraging text to label and explain. Increase your audience’s tolerance of design issues by making your visuals aesthetically pleasing. Work to gain audience acceptance of your visual designs.</li>\n",
    "<li>Tell a story. Craft a story with clear beginning (plot), middle (twists), and end (call to action). Leverage conflict and tension to grab and maintain your audience’s attention. Consider the order and manner of your narrative. Utilize the power of repetition to help your stories stick. Employ tactics like vertical and horizontal logic, reverse storyboarding, and seeking a fresh perspective to ensure that your story comes across clearly in your communication.</li>\n",

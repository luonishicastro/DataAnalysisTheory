When we're at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell - probably about those two pearls.</i>"

The more specific you can be about who your audience is, the better position you will be for successful communication. By trying to communicate to too many different people with diparate needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you can't communicate to any one of them as effectively as you could if you narrowed your target audience. It's also helpful to think about the relationship that you have with your audience and how you expect that they will perceive you.\n",

    "The first act sets up the story. It introduces the main character, or protagonist, their relationships, and the world in which they live. After the setup, the main character is confronted with an incident. The attempt to deal with this incident typically leads to a more dramatic situation. This is known as the first turning point. The first turning point ensures that life will never be the same for the main character and raises the dramatic question to be answered in the climax of the play.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The second act makes up the bulk of the story. It depicts the main character's attempt to resolve the problem created through the first turning point. Often, the main character lacks the skills to deal with the problem he faces, and, as a result, finds himself encountering increasingly worsening situations. This is known as the character arc, where the main character goes through major changes in his real life as a result of what is happening. He may have to learn new skills or reach a higher sense of awareness of who he is and what he is capable of in order to deal with his situation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The third act resolves the story and its subplots. It includes a climax, where the tensions of the story reach the highest point of intensity. Finally, the dramatic question introduced in the first act is answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are a couple of lessons to be learned here. First, the three-act structure of a story (setup, conflict and resolution) can serve as a model for us when it comes to communicating in general. Second, the conflict and tension are an integral part of a story.\n",

    "Roberty McKee says there are two ways to persuade people: the first one is conventional rhetoric. In the business world, this typically takes the form of PowerPoint slides filled with bulleted facts and statistics. It's an intellectual process. But it is problematic, because while you're trying to persuade your audience, they are arguing with you in their heads. If you do succeed in persuading them, you've only done so on an intellectual basis. That's not good enough, because people are not inspired to act by reason alone.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The second way to persuade is through story. Stories unite an idea with an emotion, arousing the audience's attention and energy. Because it requires creativity, telling a compelling story is harder than conventional rhetoric. But delving into your creative recesses is worth it because story allows you to engage your audience on an entirely new level.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The meta-lesson here is that we can use stories to engage our audience emotionally in a way that goes beyond what facts can do. More specifically, we can use questions (like 'what does my protagonist want in order to restore balance in his or her life?', 'what is the core need?', 'what is keeping my protagonist from achieving his or her desire?', 'how would my protagonist decide to act in order to achieve his or her desire in the face of antagonistic forces?') to identify stories to frame our communications.\n",
